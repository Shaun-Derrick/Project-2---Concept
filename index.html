        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Our goal is to make recycling accessible to everyone while making the
          process as easy and quick as possible. <br />
          We believe that by increasing the accessibility of recycling
          facilities it will enable more people to recycle. <br />
          If we enable more people to recycle there will be fewer recycleables
          reaching the landfill and therefore it will provide a cleaner and
          healthier environment.
